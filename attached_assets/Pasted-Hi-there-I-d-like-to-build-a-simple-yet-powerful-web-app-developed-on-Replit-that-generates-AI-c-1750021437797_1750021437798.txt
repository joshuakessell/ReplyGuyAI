Hi there,

I’d like to build a simple yet powerful web app (developed on Replit) that generates AI-crafted replies to Reddit posts and comments based on user customization.

Here’s what the app should do:

✅ Core Features
Reddit Link Input:

The homepage should have a clean UI with a single input field:

“Paste a Reddit post or comment URL”

Upon submission, the app will:

Parse the Reddit link.

Fetch the original post content and, if it’s a comment, also gather the parent post, preceding comment chain, and the target comment.

Reply Customization Panel:
Once the content is fetched and displayed in a readable format, show a modal or inline section with:

A text input field labeled:

“What direction should your comment take?”

A reply length selector:

Small (≤20 words)

Medium (~50 words)

Long (~100 words)

Custom (with a small input for word count)

A mood selector with preset options:

Witty

Comforting

Sad

Custom (text input)

A “Create Reply” button

AI Response Generation:

When “Create Reply” is clicked:

Display a “Processing…” animation to indicate it's working.

Use the collected Reddit content + user input (direction, mood, word count) to call an AI API (e.g., OpenAI).

The reply is then shown in a styled container beneath the controls.

Post-Generation Actions:
Below the AI-generated reply, provide:

🔁 Regenerate Reply

❌ Clear

📋 Copy to Clipboard (to paste back into Reddit manually)

🛠️ Technical Requirements
Web app built using React (preferred) or Vanilla JS.

Host frontend on Replit, and if needed, create a small Node.js/Express backend to act as a proxy for AI API requests (to hide keys).

Fetch Reddit content either through:

Reddit’s public API (if available for anonymous access), or

Fallback: embed the post/comment HTML and parse it from the DOM with proper sanitization.

All UI should be responsive, clean, and minimal, with support for light and dark modes.

🎯 Goal
To create a web-based Reddit companion tool that allows users to craft expressive, thoughtful, or funny replies to Reddit posts or comments, guided by AI and customizable intent. This removes the need for a browser extension and allows cross-platform access from any device with a browser.

Let me know if you need mockups or a suggested file structure to start development.

Thanks!
Joshua
